# Conversion-Focused Frontend Rules

These rules define how to design, build, instrument, and roll out conversion-oriented UI/UX across the storefront. They cover components, content modeling, analytics, SEO, accessibility, and performance constraints.

## Global Principles

- Performance first:
  - Keep LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, TBT < 200ms. Prefer Server Components, avoid blocking JS.
  - Use next/image with responsive sizes, lazy loading, and priority for above-the-fold hero/ATC areas.
  - Code-split heavy widgets via dynamic import with ssr: false only when strictly needed.

- Accessibility:
  - All interactive elements have keyboard focus, ARIA labels, and visible focus states.
  - Carousels: provide controls, pause on hover/focus, `aria-roledescription="carousel"`, `aria-live="polite"` for announcements.
  - Banners/announcements: use `role="status"` or `aria-live="polite"` for time-bound updates.

- i18n & Copy:
  - All strings sourced from i18n dictionaries or Strapi; no hard-coded copy.
  - Keep concise, benefit-driven copy; avoid jargon; include social proof and risk-reversal cues.

- SEO:
  - Use semantic tags (section, header, nav, aside, footer).
  - Add JSON-LD where applicable (e.g., AggregateRating on PDP, BreadcrumbList).
  - Avoid duplicate banners that push content excessively below the fold.

- Analytics & Experimentation:
  - Emit GA4 events via a centralized tracker (e.g., track('event_name', payload)).
  - Include data attributes: data-analytics-id, data-variant, data-source.
  - Support A/B via feature flags (e.g., GrowthBook or env flag) and variants prop.

- CMS-driven:
  - Components read content from Strapi (title, subtitle, body, images, ratings, thresholds, badges, CTAs, toggles).
  - Support Preview mode and ISR revalidation via Strapi webhooks.

- Safety:
  - No client-side calls to Fourthwall; use server-side BFF endpoints.
  - Do not expose secrets; use env only.

## Locations & Conventions

- Components:
  - Place reusable conversion UI in apps/web/src/components/conversion/*
  - Name components with clear intent (e.g., ReviewCarousel, TrustBadges, PaymentMethodsStrip).

- Props:
  - Common props: id, title, subtitle, body, items, cta, href, icon, image, variant, theme, badge, tags, start/end date, showClose, dismissKey.
  - Analytics props: analyticsId, analyticsContext, variant, position/index.
  - Accessibility props as needed: ariaLabel, ariaDescribedBy.

- Styling:
  - Tailwind + shadcn/ui primitives; ensure focus-visible, prefers-reduced-motion.
  - framer-motion for micro-interactions that do not block LCP.

- Instrumentation:

  - Standard GA4 events:
    - view_promotion, select_promotion
    - view_item, add_to_cart, begin_checkout
    - generate_lead, sign_up, subscribe
  - Example payload fields: { id, component, variant, placement, value, currency, product_id, list_name }

## Strapi Modeling (Guidance)

- Collections:

  - banners (title, body, type, priority, schedule, locale, dismissKey)
  - gifts (threshold, gift_items[], locale, active_window)
  - trust_badges (title, icon, description, link, locale)
  - faqs (category, question, answer, locale)
  - ugc_entries (media, alt, rights_cleared, source, locale)

- Single Types:
  - site_promotions (announcement bars, thresholds)
  - payment_methods_config
  - guarantees_policy_snippet

- Conventions:
  - Include isActive, startAt, endAt, locales; review in Preview mode before publish.

## Analytics & QA

- Event naming:
  - Use snake_case for event names; include component and placement in params.
  - Example: track('view_promotion', { component: 'review_carousel', placement: 'pdp_top', variant: 'A', promotion_id: 'rev-hero-1' })

- QA gates per component:
  - No CLS > 0.1 when mounted.
  - Keyboard navigable; tab order logical.
  - Reduced motion respected.
  - Lighthouse: Performance â‰¥ 90, Accessibility â‰¥ 95, SEO â‰¥ 90 on key pages.

- Experimentation:
  - Each component accepts variant prop.
  - Read experiment flags from server (BFF or env) to ensure SSR-consistent UI.
  - Log assignment once per session.

## Rollout & Revalidation

- ISR tags:
  - Tag pages using the displayed content (e.g., 'promo', 'reviews', 'banners').
  - Strapi publish/update should POST /api/revalidate with matching tag or path.

- Preview:
  - All components must render correctly in preview mode with draft content.

- Fallbacks:
  - If CMS data missing, display conservative default or hide the component without layout shift.

## Security & Compliance

- Do not inject third-party scripts without lazy loading and consent checks (CMP).
- Sanitize any user-generated content (UGC).
- Do not display PII; anonymize analytics context.
